## My Projects 

### Word Frequency 
Word Frequency is a web application that takes a user-provided segment of text and returns 
the number of times each word appears in it. The program was built using HTML5, CSS3, and 
vanilla JavaScript. Although this project uses several items from the front-end developer's 
toolbox, string and array manipulation were the most important.

### Blog 
Blog is a web application that allows the user to create, read, update, and delete blog 
data. The data is hard-coded into the application; therefore, none of the changes are 
permanent. I built this program to showcase my ability to manage data.

### Math Quiz 
Math Quiz is a web application that tests the user on easy addition and subtraction math 
problems. There are ten questions, and the user's score is displayed at the end. I plan 
to add levels of difficulty in the future. I built this program to showcase my ability 
to use React.

### Country Flag Finder 
Country Flag Finder is a web application that allows the user to search for a country's 
flag. I built this program to demonstrate my ability to use and manage API data. 
Additionally, this program uses regular expressions to create a dynamic dropdown menu 
to enhance the user experience.
